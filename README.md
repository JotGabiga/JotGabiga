## About me

### Hi, I’m Justyna — a Software Engineer with 3.5 years of experience building and maintaining full-stack web applications using React, TypeScript, Node.js and PostgreSQL.

I focus on delivering clean, maintainable code and high-quality features supported by automated tests (Jest, Cypress, Cucumber). I’m comfortable working in Agile teams, contributing to architecture discussions, code reviews and shaping technical decisions. I enjoy turning requirements into well-designed, test-covered features that solve real problems for users and drive business outcomes.

While my core strength is frontend engineering, I’m also experienced on the backend with Node.js, and I’m continuously developing in both areas. I’m interested in how frontend engineering and UX intersect — especially in the context of usability, accessibility and improving product quality — but my primary focus remains building robust web applications.
