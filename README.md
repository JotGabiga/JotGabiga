## About me

### Hi, I’m Justyna — a Software Engineer with 3.5 years of experience building and maintaining full-stack web applications using React, TypeScript, Node.js and PostgreSQL. ###

I focus on delivering clean, maintainable code and high-quality features supported by automated tests (Jest, Cypress, Cucumber). With a strong attention to UX, I care about creating intuitive, accessible and user-friendly interfaces that solve real user problems.

I’m comfortable working in Agile environments, contributing to code reviews, shaping technical decisions and writing automated tests that ensure long-term code quality.

Currently exploring the space between frontend engineering and UX — aiming to bridge both worlds in my career.
