## About me

### Hi I am Justyna, a beginner Frontend developer excited to build, develop, and create. Currently switching careers from an Architect into Frontend developer. 

I have been learning frontend programming for two years. In April 2021, I graduated from a [Web programming course with CodersCrew](https://www.coderscamp.edu.pl/) to further deepen my programming skills.

I am an enthusiastic and a social person who loves to take up new challenges and learn new skills. I am also passionate about UX/UI design and the craft of building beautiful and accessible experiences that meet users needs. 

From my previous professional experience I can bring a technical flair, a passion for taking care of the visual side of the project and good organization skills.
